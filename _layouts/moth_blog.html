    A long while ago my grandfather was leaving the shop, at the doorstep he saw this peculiar bluish green colored moth laying on the ground. At first he was confused, then a sort of supersticious fear rose over him due to the fact that a few nights previous he had watched a scary movie about the mothman. He laughed off the beliefs and decided to take the rare creature home to show the family. Luckily none of his superstitions came true, and we kept the moth preserved in a drawer for a few years because we thought that we could put it in plastic and use it as a paper weight. After all the little corpse was beautiful and rare.

      <h4>what I think</h4>
      <p>Well think about it; this is the rotting corpse of a creature that once lived like you and me. Take any other corpse and place it in a white bowl saying "this is pretty" and watch the looks people give you. While its light green wings stretch out with adorned with patterns and streaks. And it's fuzzy body seem delicately sewn together to make a work of art, it still is a lifeless dead body. It makes you wonder what beauty actually means, in most cases it is not really the merit of a life, instead the appearence of what they become. When I see this small creature, its legs curled and insides hollow, and I look into its dark black eyes I feel a feeling of sadness wash over me. It saddens me because I know that being was like me, it tried to live and hopefully it lived a good life, but now all of it's merits mean nothing and slowly it's insides rot out. Is that beautiful? In a certain way it is, in a certain way it is absolutely terrible. Truly<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; "> beauty is in the eye of the beholder...</span> and has no real definition here.</p>
