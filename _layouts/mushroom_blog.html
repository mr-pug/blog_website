    This image is a picture taken of a rare forest fungus that grow in small little pink stocks that reach up and pour spores out from their tips. I found this image on the internet. Still I have seen very strange fungi in my life, probably more than most in my adventures into the woods, they have always intrigued me with their stange colors and way of life.

      <h4>what I think</h4>
      <p>I think that Fungus is like an alien lifeform, it does not belong on earth. I think that everything about it is stange, it is unlike vegtable and it is unlike animal, it is unlike virus, truly it is it's own class of life. Had things had turned out different on earth I believe that the mushroom would have taken over the whole planet. By some means they have made it across the entire globe inbetween every crack and crevis, they seem to be happy being small and eating off rot, or atleast the thought of eating the rest of us has not yet crossed their mind. we are lucky that the ones we are familar with are small and grey and eassily smushed. <br> <br> They come in many different verieties and within each sect take up multiple genders even reaching up to seven or eight in some species. The way they live is much like a plant in some ways, but completely different in other ways. Infact chances are you are inhaling microscopic spores at this very moment. The quote states they are ina  position lower than man, animals, and plants. I believe that they sure are alien, but lower? I would <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; ">never </span>say that they are lower...</p>
