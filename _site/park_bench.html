This picture is a lot like the original picture on the homepage of my blog. I found these images on the internet in strange locations and I collected them. Upon seeing them I found myself staring, almost caught unable to move, looking at the scenery and the wonderful place, The lighting seems warm, through the screen you can almost smell the flowers and hear bees buzzing close by. It looks as if it is in the park, and on the park bench is the most strange impossible thing just sitting there. An anime girl with a little cat curled up against her leg; however that makes this scene impossible to ever exist, even though it is in the real world, an anime girl can never be in the real world. It gives the whole picture a feeling of "impossible fantasy."

      <h4>what I think</h4>
      <p>Man this is a rough one to write, and that quote is also rough, because it's one of those situations where what I think about the matter really does not matter. What we have before us is reality, and fantasy no matter how much we think or attempt to merge the two they can never be. I think this image is very pretty, I like it, and in a strange way I wish I could be there, but no matter what that can never be. It's like a dream that can never come true. A place in a video game you can never be at in real life. Now I am not going to pretend like an anime in real life is the end all of what happiness means to me, because if that were the case I would be doomed to forever be unhappy. <br> <br> That quote, I do not know if I agree with it, One thing about me is I hate dreams, they are not real, they do not last, and if they are so good, they just leave you waking up sad. What I like is dreams that are real. So maybe this image is not worth liking or appreciating. Even if it helps you to survive reality, that is only like using a lie to keep living. Even if you love it to death, you will never get to be there. <br> <br> But for some reason I still think that it is pretty...</p>
